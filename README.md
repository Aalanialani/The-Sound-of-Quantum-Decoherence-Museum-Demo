# The-Sound-of-Quantum-Decoherence-Museum-Demo
This is all my JavaScript and CSS code used to create a demo on React for the museum of science and industry in Chicago. I am taking the T1 and T2 values of time it takes for a quantum system to decay and mapping those values from microseconds to hertz to create an auditory experience of quantum decoherence.
